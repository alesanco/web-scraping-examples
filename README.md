# web-scraping-examples
Examples to start learning web scraping in general.

# Start site to scrape
Enter the **site2scrape** folder and run
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to see a fantastic demo.

# Examples
There are only three examples available for now.

You can run the **/shell/scraper.sh** in a Linux terminal to play with regex, or you can improve **scrapy** (Python) or **nodejs** (JavaScript) mini projects to create your own tool!
